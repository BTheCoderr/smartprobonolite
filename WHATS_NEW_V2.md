Clear prompt engineering and state machine design make it easy to:
- Add new document types
- Train team members

### **Immediate Priorities:**
1. Test with real intake forms from various practice areas

3. Refine prompts based on actual usage patterns
4. Add inline editing to OutputViewer

### **Short-term (v0.3):**
- Save conversation history to database

- Custom firm name configuration

### **Medium-term (v1.0):**
- RAG for jurisdiction-specific guidance

## üìä Before & After Comparison

### **Chat Message Example:**

**Before (v1):**
```
Assistant: I have analyzed the document. The extracted information is:

```

**After (v2 - Ermi):**
```
Ermi: Sure thing. I've reviewed the file ‚Äî it looks like a custody 
petition for Maria Lopez regarding her son Jaden Lopez, age 8.

Before I start a draft, could you confirm whether this is for 
initial filing or modification of custody?
```

From: Maria Lopez

[Generic template content...]
```
