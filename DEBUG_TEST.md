# üêõ Debug Test - Enhanced Logging

## ‚úÖ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Enhanced Debugging:** Added detailed logs for system prompts, messages, and Groq responses
2. **Better Fallback Responses:** More specific responses based on user input (NDA, review, etc.)
3. **Response Validation:** Check if Groq returns empty responses and use fallback

## üß™ **Now Test This:**

### **Step 1: Try a Specific Request**
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard**
2. Type: **"Help me draft an NDA for a new client"**
3. Click Send

### **Step 2: Check Terminal Logs**
Look at your terminal (where `npm run dev` is running) for these new logs:

```
AI Provider: groq
User message: Help me draft an NDA for a new client
System prompt: [long prompt text]
Recent messages: [array of messages]
Full Groq Response: [complete JSON response]
Extracted AI Response: [actual AI text]
```

### **Step 3: What to Look For**

**If Groq is working:**
- You'll see a detailed AI response about NDAs
- The logs will show the full Groq JSON response

**If Groq is failing:**
- You'll see "Using fallback response for: [your message]"
- The fallback should now be more specific about NDAs

## üîç **Diagnosis:**

Based on what you see in the terminal logs, we can determine:

### **Scenario A: Groq API Working**
```
Full Groq Response: {"choices":[{"message":{"content":"I'd be happy to help you draft an NDA..."}}]}
```
**Solution:** Groq is working, but maybe the responses are too generic

### **Scenario B: Groq API Failing**
```
Full Groq Response: {"choices":[{"message":{"content":""}}]}
```
**Solution:** Groq returns empty responses - we need to fix the model or parameters

### **Scenario C: Groq API Error**
```
Groq API Error: 401 Unauthorized
```
**Solution:** API key issue

## üéØ **Test Messages to Try:**

1. **"Help me draft an NDA"** (should trigger NDA-specific fallback)
2. **"Review this intake form"** (should trigger review-specific fallback)
3. **"Draft a client letter"** (should trigger letter-specific fallback)

---

## üìã **Expected Results:**

**Before:** Generic "I'm here to help! Could you tell me more..."

**After:** Specific responses like:
- "I can help draft an NDA or agreement. Please provide the key details like parties involved, confidential information scope, and duration."
- "I'd be happy to review your document. Please share the content or upload the file..."

---

**Go test it now and tell me what you see in the terminal logs!** 

This will tell us exactly what's happening with the Groq API calls.
