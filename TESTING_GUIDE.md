# 🧪 Testing Guide - Fix Applied!

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Updated Groq Model:** Changed from `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (the correct model name)
2. **Added Error Handling:** Better error logging to see what's happening
3. **Added Debugging:** Console logs to track the API calls

## 🎯 **Now Test This:**

### **Step 1: Try Chatting Again**
1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard**
2. In the chat box, type:
   ```
   Help me draft a client letter for John Smith who needs help with a personal injury case.
   ```
3. Click **Send**

### **Step 2: Check Terminal Logs**
Look at your terminal where `npm run dev` is running. You should now see:
- `AI Provider: groq`
- `User message: [your message]`
- `Groq Response: [the actual response]`

### **Step 3: What Should Happen**
- ✅ You should get a **real AI response** from Groq
- ✅ The response should appear in the chat
- ✅ No more "No response generated" error

## 🐛 **If It Still Doesn't Work:**

### **Check Terminal Logs**
Look for these error messages in your terminal:
- `Groq API Error:` - This will tell us what's wrong
- `AI Provider:` - Should show `groq`
- Any other error messages

### **Common Issues:**
1. **API Key Issue:** If you see `401 Unauthorized`
2. **Model Issue:** If you see `404 Not Found` 
3. **Rate Limit:** If you see `429 Too Many Requests`

---

## 🚀 **Expected Result:**

After the fix, you should see something like:

**Your message:** "Help me draft a client letter for John Smith..."

**Ermi's response:** "I'd be happy to help draft a client letter for John Smith's personal injury case. To create a comprehensive engagement letter, I'll need a few key details..."
