## üí¨ More Example Conversations

### **Example 2: Contract Dispute**

**Lawyer:** I need help with a breach of contract case.

**Ermi:** I can help with that. Do you have intake information or contract details you'd like me to review? Or would you prefer to tell me about the case, and I'll take notes?

**Lawyer:** The client is John Smith. He hired ABC Construction for a home renovation. They didn't finish the work and he wants his deposit back.

**Ermi:** Got it. Here's what I have so far:

- **Client:** John Smith
- **Opposing Party:** ABC Construction
- **Case Type:** Breach of Contract (Construction)
- **Issue:** Unfinished work, seeking deposit refund

A few quick questions:
1. What was the total contract amount and deposit paid?
2. Do you have a written contract or just verbal agreement?

**Lawyer:** $50,000 total, $15,000 deposit. Yes, we have a signed contract.

**Ermi:** Perfect. That helps a lot. Would you like me to draft:
- A demand letter to ABC Construction?
- A complaint for breach of contract?
- Or a client engagement letter first?
